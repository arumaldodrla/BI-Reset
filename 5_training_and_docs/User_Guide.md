# BI Reset User Guide

**Welcome to BI Reset!** This guide will help you get started with using the platform to explore your data and create insightful reports.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. Logging In

To begin, navigate to the BI Reset URL provided by your administrator and log in with your credentials. You can use your email and password or sign in with Google/GitHub if enabled.

### 1.2. The Home Screen

After logging in, you will land on the home screen. Here you will find:

-   **My Dashboards**: A collection of your favorite and most frequently used dashboards.
-   **Recent Reports**: A list of reports you have recently viewed or created.
-   **Navigation Bar**: On the left, you can navigate to different sections of the platform, including Dashboards, Reports, and the AI Analyst.

## 2. Using the AI Analyst

The AI Analyst is the fastest way to get answers from your data.

1.  Navigate to the **AI Analyst** section from the main navigation.
2.  In the chat input box at the bottom, type your question in plain English. For example:
    -   "What were our total sales last month?"
    -   "Show me the top 5 customers by revenue in Q3."
    -   "Compare sales for product A and product B over the last year."
3.  Press Enter. The AI Analyst will process your request and generate the best visualization (chart or table) to answer your question.
4.  You can then save the generated report to a dashboard or ask a follow-up question.

## 3. Creating Reports Manually

For more complex analysis, you can use the visual report builder.

1.  Navigate to the **Reports** section and click **New Report**.
2.  This will open the report builder interface.
3.  **Select Your Data**: On the left, choose the data you want to work with. This will be based on the semantic models your administrator has set up (e.g., "Sales Transactions," "Customer Details").
4.  **Build Your Report**:
    -   **Measures**: Add the metrics you want to analyze (e.g., `Sum of Revenue`, `Count of Orders`).
    -   **Dimensions**: Add the fields you want to group by (e.g., `Country`, `Product Category`, `Date`).
5.  **Visualize**: Choose the visualization type that best suits your data (e.g., Bar Chart, Line Chart, Table).
6.  **Save**: Once you are happy with your report, click **Save**, give it a name, and choose which dashboard to add it to.

## 4. Working with Dashboards

Dashboards provide a high-level view of your key metrics.

-   **Creating a Dashboard**: Navigate to the **Dashboards** section and click **New Dashboard**.
-   **Adding Reports**: While viewing a dashboard, click **Edit** and then **Add Report** to add existing reports to the grid.
-   **Filtering**: Use the filter bar at the top of a dashboard to filter all reports by a specific dimension (e.g., a date range, a region).
-   **Exporting**: You can export an entire dashboard as a PDF for sharing.
